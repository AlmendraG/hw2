## Programming Problem Notes 
	- I could not, for my life, implement amazon.cpp. 
for this reason, using the make target will probably
be a disaster. To compile the code that I am sure does 
work, please use g++. The programs you could compile are 
util.cpp, book.cpp, movie.cpp, clothing.cpp, mydatastore.cpp,
and product_parser.cpp
	- I did alter the makefile to compile all the above codes 
	- For util.cpp, I have inculded a little snippet 
of code that demonstrates how I knew that the parseStringToWords() 
actually worked. I included a main so you could play around and 
use some product names from the database 
	- My problem here is mainly on amazon.cpp, since I was unsure on how to 
declare the ds with MyDataStore. I did include an idea of how I would implement 
the functions I created in mydatastore.cpp
	- I also want to explain amazonUser in mydatastore.cpp,
this is basically a helper function I used to see if the user existed. 
	- I was not sure if user duplicates were allowed or not, if they
were not allowed, I would have probably done some type of check and 
ignored the new user
